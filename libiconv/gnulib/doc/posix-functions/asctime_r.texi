Gnulib module: extensions

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function has an incompatible declaration on some platforms:
Solaris 11.4 (when @code{_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS} is not defined).
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
POSIX says this function is obsolescent and it is planned to be
removed in a future version.
Use the function @code{strftime} (or even @code{sprintf}) instead.
However, @code{strftime} is locale dependent.
@item
This function may overflow its output buffer if its argument
specifies a year before 1000 or after 9999.
@xref{ctime}.
@item
Although it is tempting to call this function on the value that
functions like @code{localtime} return, this is typically a mistake.
On most current platforms, these functions return a null pointer for
timestamps out of range, and this function has undefined behavior in
that case.
